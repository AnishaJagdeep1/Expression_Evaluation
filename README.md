# Expression_Evaluation
 The Java file "Expression" solves mathematical expressions that may consist of numbers, variables, and arrays.

An example would be 6 + 2(x * Array[5]) - 8/4 - 9 * 0 given that x = 3 and Array[5] = 8. The answer given when this file is executed is 190.

Each expression is separated into tokens, and all of the variables and arrays will be collected from the expression and separated into lists.

The values of the variables and array elements will be loaded.

The expression is evaluated: stacks are used to correctly evaluate the expression, following the rules of PEMDAS.
